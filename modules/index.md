# Welcome to the Introduction to NGS Workshop (30 Sep - 4 Oct 2019)
<br>

The Introduction to NGS Data Analysis is a Two-day, hands-on workshop that offers attendees a basic understanding of NGS data analysis workflows. 
The workshop provides hands-on computational experience in analysis of NGS data using common analytical approaches for QC, Alignment, RNA-Seq data and de novo genome assembly.
